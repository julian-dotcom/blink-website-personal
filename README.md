This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## How to deploy

Command to generate build.

```bash
npm run build --legacy-peer-deps
```

This will generate a /.next folder and an /out folder that both contain a build.
